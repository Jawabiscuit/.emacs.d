- Trying auctex package
  - Not sure if it is really necessary since only interested in exporting from org ATM

- Advanced Exporting
- org-export backend customizations
- Options > Customize Emacs > Specific Group > org-export
- Enabled beamer, latex, md backends
- Downloaded MiKTeX for Windows and installed
  - https://miktex.org/download
- Added bin directory to path since emacs was not finding pdflatex
  - Added to %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\runemacs.bat
    - set PATH="C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64";%PATH%
  - Same problem as this guy: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/auctex/2012-02/msg00005.html
  - 'pdflatex' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file

- Objective: org-export with code syntax highlighting
- minted tool seems to be choice
- Verified MiKTeX package manager installed minted

1. Changed format of of log files from txt to org
2. Changed log entry titles to look like the one above
3. Learned about org-mode structure templates and binding them to key chords
4. [[*https://blog.aaronbieber.com/2016/11/23/creating-org-mode-structure-templates.html]]
5. Structure templates added to [[file:settings/setup-org.el::;;%20https://blog.aaronbieber.com/2016/11/23/creating-org-mode-structure-templates.html][setup-org.el]]
6. Create a block like the one below by typing "<el <TAB>"
7. Learned about using =(debug)= in lisp interactive sessions

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Debug practice
;; d: step through
;; c: continue
;; e: eval expression
;; q: top level (debug code for "quit")
;; C-h m from the debugger window for more cmds
(save-excursion
  (goto-char 0)
  (while (re-search-forward "\\w+" (point-max) t)
    (debug)
    (match-string-no-properties 0)))
#+END_SRC

1. Defined key binding for evaluating el code blocks

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
; eval-defun is not bound
; (define-key global-map "\ew" 'other-window)
(define-key lisp-interaction-mode-map (kbd "<C-return>") 'eval-defun)
#+END_SRC

1. Deprecating =casey-find-corresponding-file= and
   =casey-find-corresponding-file-other-window= in favor of using
   projectile key binding: @@html:<kbd>C-c p</kbd>@@
