- Trying auctex package
  - Not sure if it is really necessary since only interested in exporting from org ATM

- Advanced Exporting
  - 
- org-export backend customizations
- Options > Customize Emacs > Specific Group > org-export
- Enabled beamer, latex, md backends
- Downloaded MiKTeX for Windows and installed
  - https://miktex.org/download
- Added bin directory to path since emacs was not finding pdflatex
  - Added to %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\runemacs.bat
    - set PATH="C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\miktex\bin\x64";%PATH%
  - Same problem as this guy: https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/auctex/2012-02/msg00005.html
  - 'pdflatex' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file

- Objective: org-export with code syntax highlighting
- minted tool seems to be choice
- Verified MiKTeX package manager installed minted
