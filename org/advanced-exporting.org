* Things to keep in mind

- Even if OrgMode offers several export backends, your file is usually defined
  for one special backend. Example:
  + This file looks good if exported to "beamer"
  + This file looks bad if exported to "odt"

- The beamer backend is nice for standardized outline slides, but
  lacking design and images. So there is a good chance that your presentation
  is boring.
